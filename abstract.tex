In our study, we explored the merits and flaws of various methods for basic road scene understanding, and suggested a weakly supervised learning approach that excels both in theory and practice. Tested over different data sets, our approach gave an accuracy of 89.51\% in the best case. It has a desirable prediction stage time complexity, which is linear with regard to the size of input data. A software system as well as an open source library for convolutional auto-encoders were developed accordingly.
